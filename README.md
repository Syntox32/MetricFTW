# MetricFTW
A chrome plugin for converting imperial to metric, totally not a product of a biased opinion

## What is this?
This plugin was created for converting imperial units into metric units by searching through the current HTML document and replacing the original html, and adding a '*' to the <i>corrected</i> text so you will notice where the change took place.

Right now, only <i>pounds and lbs</i> is supported.

## How do I use it?
1. Install the plugin
2. Go on whatever site you want
3. Click the icon and press the that says "Metric FTW"
4. ???
5. Profit.
